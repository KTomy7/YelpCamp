# YelpCamp
This is a project that I did as part of the Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, which can be found on Udemy.

YelpCamp is an application for a fictional startup that allows users to create and review campgrounds and share it with other users. You must have an account in order to create campgrounds or review them.

This project was created using Node.js, Express, Bootstrap and MongoDb. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features
- Users can create, edit and delete campgrounds.
- Users can review campgrounds, also edit or remove their reviews.
