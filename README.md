# YelpCamp
This is a project that I did as part of the Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.
YelpCamp is an application for a fictional startup that allows users to create and review campgrounds and share it with other users.
This project was created using Node.js, Express, Bootstrap and MongoDb. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

## Features
- Users can create, edit and delete campgrounds.
- Users can review campgrounds, also edit or remove their reviews.
